EchoClone is a free, open source game based on the concept that things are as you see them, not as you believe they would be.

There's a set of rules which are the base of the game:

  1. If two blocks seem to be adjacent, they are.
  1. If a hole is not visible, it does not exist.
  1. If two blocks seem to form a path, they do.
  1. When you fall, you fall on the first thing you touch. (falling doesn't work yet, and jumping isn't implemented at all)

The project is currently not being actively developed. Contributions are still welcome.
