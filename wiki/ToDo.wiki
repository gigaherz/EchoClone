A Little To-Do List

= Introduction =

I have been playing the real Echochrome a bit, and I have noticed some things this clone is missing, other than the obvious


= Details =

Major things missing:
  * Proper falling.
  * Jumping

Minor things missing:
  * Perspective absence for block obstacles.
  * "Negative" black dudes which behave just like you, but you cancel each other on touch (reset to prev checkpoint).

Details:
  * Walking dude model
  * Menu
  * Sounds
  * Music
